BSRO v2.0.5b:
Thank you for downloading this pack of British-Style Road Objects made by me, Road-hog123.

All signs and road markings contained within this pack are made to conform as closely as possible to the DfT standards.

Notes:
- This pack has been made for Omsi 2 and WILL NOT WORK with Omsi 1.
- This pack is NOT COMPATIBLE with any previous versions of my pack. It is standalone and WILL NOT WORK as a replacement to version 1.5.3 of the pack for all Omsi 1 maps and maps released before 16th February 2015.
- I cannot be held personally responsible if the installation of this pack breaks any other mods, maps or your Omsi installation.

Installation:
- Locate your Omsi 2 installation directory (by default "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\OMSI 2\" for 64-bit Windows systems).
- If you have a previous installation of this pack, I would advise its removal before the installation of a new version.
- Copy the contents of the "OMSI 2" folder into the "OMSI 2" folder that is your install directory.
- Unless you have installed any pre-releases of this pack, you should not need to overwrite any files.

You are welcome to use my content in a payware map, however my pack MUST NOT be included in the paid download and instead a link should be included to my pack as a dependency of your map.

Known Bugs:
- Some signs may not have attachment points to attach signs beneath them.
- Snow textures do not work for road destination markings - You can't change fonts depending on season, so I don't know how to fix this.
- Poles aren't casting shadows. Not sure what is causing this.
- Entering text too long in the signs can cause the sign to vanish and stop other tiles loading.

Once again, thank you for downloading this pack. Enjoy! :)
